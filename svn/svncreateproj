##remove the trunk if was already there:
svn rm  -m "" $MYSVN/$pkg/trunk 

##create the directory struct, if it is already there will just complain
 svn mkdir -m "" $MYSVN/$pkg 
 svn mkdir -m "" $MYSVN/$pkg/trunk 
 svn mkdir -m "" $MYSVN/$pkg/branches
 svn mkdir -m "" $MYSVN/$pkg/tags

###import the local package into the trunk, no need to remove .svn dirs, they will be ignored
 cd $pkg
 svn import -m "" . $MYSVN/$pkg/trunk
 cd ..

##create a backup of the original and switch to the newly created trunk
 mv $pkg $pkg.bak
 svn co $MYSVN/$pkg/trunk $pkg
